					<h1>Welcome!</h1>
					<p>Welcome to our travel blog. We are a father and daughter who love to travel and want to share our adventures. </p>
					<p>Dean ---My love travel first started when I was in collge at Dordt College (now Univeristy). My study abroad at Dordt was in Mexico for 3 weeks. I enjoyed it so much that after graduation I went back for 2 more years 3 weeks at a time to continue my education there. During that time there were opportunities to explore and meet people. Mexico remained an important part of my education.  Working in Costa Rica and the DR also impacted my desire to travel, not as a tourist but to take the time to understand the culture and people.  A motorcycle is a conversation starter and opens doors into lives that other methods of travel do not. Therefore,  while I enjoy riding, the motorcycle best serves as a tool to get me into culture and make friends.</p>
					<p>Emily --- Ever since I was a little girl I have always wanted to be a world traveler and explore any chance I got. Listening to my dad's stories made my urge to travel even stronger and through his mentorship and advice I was able to travel to Honduras for 6 weeks and love every second of it. For the next four months I will be living in the glorious country of Lithuania and sharing my experinces here.</p>
