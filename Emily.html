					<p> Ever since I was a little girl, I have always wanted to study in another country even for just a semester. All my sisters had done it and me being the youngest wanted to copy them and do it to. Since then, the deamination built up inside of me and finally in 2019 I entered university. I immediately went to the study abroad office and started to look at my options. Usually, people from my university go to countries like Spain, the Netherlands, and England but none of those sparked my interest for some reason. Finally, I found the program right up my ally. It was a semester (four months) studying in LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania. In all honesty I hadn’t even heard of Lithuania before this and the thought of going somewhere totally out of norm of my university lit the flame of adventure in me. I immediately fell in love with the thought of going and from then on, I was determined to go.  </p>

					<h1>Entry to Vilnius</h1>
					<p> 
					Then came the difficult part of planning how exactly I would get there and all the paperwork that needed to be done. A note of advice, DON’T TRY TO RENEW A PASSPORT BY YOURSELF. You just end up spending more money than you would if you just went to the office and sent it through them. Then I had to wait until my new passport came in to be able to apply for a visa. Once my passport came in my dad and I franticly got plane tickets to Chicago, and I had a meeting at the visa application center to give them all my paperwork and get fingerprinted. It makes a difference to go over all the paperwork needed at least four times before even getting to the visa center because it makes the whole process go a lot quicker. After all that work, I was finally ready to board the plane to my home for the next four months. 
				</p>
					<p>On August 12 my aunt and mom dropped my off at the airport and I was on my way. Due to covid I had to get a PCR test before getting to the airport but apparently, I did the wrong one and had to get a rapid test at the airport and dump a good $200 for it. Okay, now I am good to go, right? Thankfully I made it to my gate on time and boarded the plane. I flew about 10 hours to Frankfort, Germany and then ran across the airport and through customs to catch my next flight from Frankfort to Vilnius, Lithuania. I landed in Vilnius to a beautiful sunny day and because I was arriving before the other abroad students, I had to find my own transportation to Klaipeda. I reserved a van to drive me to LCC. The 4-hour van ride from Vilnius to Klaipeda was wonderful, ya know besides trying to sleep because you didn’t sleep the entire time on the plane of course. Any how I made it to Klaipeda and moved into my dorm! On August 24 me and the program leaders took a bus back to Vilnius to pick up the rest of the American students and stay three days in Vilnius to explore. In those three days we explored a good portion of Vilnius including The Hill of Three Crosses, old town, and the KGB museum. Vilnius is truly a beautiful place and there is so much history within it that I don’t think many Americans can understand fully. If you are curious, a simple google search of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states will give you a good outline of what I learned in those three days.

				<h1>August - September</h1>
					<p>The rest of August was filled with preparing for classes and exploring a few towns near Klaipeda. My favorites being Nida and Palanga. In Nida is in a small sliver of land called the Curonian Split that stretches from Lithuania to Russia (the small portion of Russia between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea). Palanga is a coast town on the Baltic Sea with a beautiful beach where you can go do homework and each some amazing authentic Lithuanian food. </p>

				<h1>October</h1>
					<p>In October the program took us on a weekend trip to Talan, Estonia and Riga, Latvia. Please note that before entering any country in the EU make sure to look up with their regulations are regarding Covid. Most countries, as of October 2021, allow fully vaccinated, those with antibodies, and those who have taken a PCR test in the last 48 hours to enter along with filling out tracking forms with QR codes in case of an outbreak. Back to the trip, we first traveled via private bus overnight to Estonia (9 hours) and had breakfast at a very nice hotel. We then went to our hostel and dropped off our things. We had a tour of Talan and enjoyed a traditional medieval dinner that night. The next day we went souvenir shopping and then hopped on the bus and traveled four hours to Riga Latavia. In Riga we had a tour and then that night we were free to explore on our own to see the Riga night life. A group of us went to a karaoke bar where we were the only ones in there and had an amazing time. The next morning, we again did some shopping and then rode the bus back to Lithuania. We stopped at the hill of crosses where there are thousands of crosses planted into the ground as a remembrance of those who have passed on and showing their love of God and religion. </p>
